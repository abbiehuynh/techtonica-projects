This assignment will check for proficiency in: NodeJS, ExpressJS, and how connect your backend with the frontend, as well as the following:
- Connect to 3rd party API
- Showing data from an API call
- Create dynamic API requests with user input
- Parse JSON and display data using React
- Connecting data between Express and React

- Creating React components and filling them with dynamic data
- Using callback functions to pass data from a child to parent component
- Learn how to use and modify code from a template


**Project Requirements**
- 15+ commits
- 1+ PR
- README with a visual of the project (i.e. gif, images, deployed version) and setup instructions
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Connected frontend and backend
- Contain at minimum city name, current weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Display the icon images for weather conditions such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy
- Responsive design
- Showcase you can implement the primary learning goals

## Installation: 
**To create the whole project**
1.  Go to your source directory in your terminal and clone the repository by running the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abbiehuynh/techtonica-projects/weather-api.git <NameNewDirectory>
```
2. `npm install` in terminal in server (techtonica-projects/weather-api) and client (/weather-api/client).

3. `npm start` on server side and `npm run dev` on client side to run weather app.

4. Visit `http://localhost:5050` for server site (ExpressJS, NodeJS) and `http://localhost:5173` for client site (React + Vite).

## Usage: 
- Input city name to choose city.
- Click button to generate city's weather data.
- Can continute to input new city names to generate a differen't city's weather information.
