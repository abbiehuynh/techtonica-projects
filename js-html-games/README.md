## Introduction: 
**Project: JS & HTML Games:**
Weekly Project for Week 4 of the Techtonica Software Engineer in Training Program

**Project Requirements**
- Make 1 or more games using JS and HTML
- Use DOM methods to connect HTML and JS to create a game
- Include a README with a demo, and instructions for how to run the code
    - Pro-tip: CSS is not a requirement of this project, so it's smart to do the basics and focus on other curriculum unless you have extra time to practice design

## Installation: 
**To create the whole project**
1.  Go to your source directory in your terminal and clone the repository by running the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abbiehuynh/techtonica-projects.git NameNewDirectory
```
2. Open using the live server extenstion to play the game (if using VSCode).

## Usage: 
- Click space bar to "jump" over obstacles in game. 
- Refresh to restart game.

## Demonstration:

Once the page has loaded, you will see your virtual pet appear on the bottom left side of the screen.
