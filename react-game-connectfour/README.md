2. `npm install` in terminal in client (techtonica-projects/contact-list-app/client).

3. `npm run dev` on client side to run Connect Four app.

![Load Game](readme-images/fairlyFour-loadGame.png)

If you click on the slot you would like to insert your token, a token will appear at the bottom most row of that column.

If you click on another slot, the next token inserted will be the token of the opposing player.

Continue taking turns to continue the game until someone "Connects Four!" The game will anounce the winner!
