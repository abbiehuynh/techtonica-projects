**Project: JS & HTML Games:**
Weekly Project for Week 5 of the Techtonica Software Engineer in Training Program

**Project Requirements**
- Write a game in React
- Practice components, props, and state
    - Have some sort of input that you receive from one component that you pass to another (such as number of tries, hi/low number, etc.)

2. Open using the live server extenstion to play the game (if using VSCode).

## Usage:

## Demonstration:

Once the page has loaded, you will see a Connect Four game board in the middle of the screen.

If you click on the slot you would like to insert your token, a token will appear at the bottom most row of that column.  
![First Token]()

If you click on another slot, the next token inserted will be the token of the opposing player. Continue taking turns to continue the game until someone "Connects Four!"
