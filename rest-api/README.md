# Project Name: REST API 

**Description:**
This project introduces organizing data from the backend using a REST API. This also includes working with Postman to test and validate API endpoints using static or hardcoded data. Postman was also used against a local database that enables comprehensive testing of API endpoints with dynamic data.

## Introduction: 
**Project:**
Building a REST API with Node and Express in the Backend for Week 6 of the Techtonica Software Engineer in Training Program.

**Project Requirements**
- Create list of hardcoded data
- Using Node and Express, create a GET router with a response that converts all using Json()
- Using that endpoint build a list of all your items in the backend(server side).
- Using Node and Express, create a route for each one of the verbs in CRUD operations in the backend. You don't need to have a frontend. You can test your API using Postman.

## Installation: 
**To create the whole project**
1.  Go to your source directory in your terminal and clone the repository by running the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abbiehuynh/techtonica-projects/rest-api.git <NameNewDirectory>
```
2. `npm install` in terminal in server (techtonica-projects/rest-api/server).

3. `npm start` to run Rest API app.

4. Visit `http://localhost:5000` for server site (ExpressJS, NodeJS).

## Testing:
- Fetches data from 


## Technologies: 
- ExpressJS, NodeJS
- Postman     
- Git
- Fetch
