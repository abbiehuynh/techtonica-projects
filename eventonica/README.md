## Introduction: 
**Project: Creating a full-stack web app with React and a database to manage events**
Weekly Project for Week 9 of the Techtonica Software Engineer in Training Program.

**Primary Learning Goals:**
1. For the first time connect to a DB and pass that data all the way up to React
2. Getting comfortable creating Express routes for CRUD operations
3. Learn about and use the UseReducer hook
4. By the end of the project, show comfort when:
    - implementing the useState hook
    - creating forms in React
    - parsing and displaying data from a DB in React
5. Stretch goal: Implement favoriting and unfavoriting events (PUT request)


**Project Requirements**
1. Use the Techtonica Template created with Vite as the foundation of your project
2. Implement GET, POST, and DELETE requests (PUT for editing is a stretch goal, not required)
3. At least 15 commits and 1 PR (every time you make a working change to the code, commit + push at least daily)
4. Obviously customize the look of your page with CSS techniques
5. Implement some basic tests
6. Create a README
7. Implement the useReducer hook


## Installation: 
**To create the whole project**
1.  Go to your source directory in your terminal and clone the repository by running the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abbiehuynh/techtonica-projects/eventonica.git <NameNewDirectory>
```
2. `npm install` in terminal in server (techtonica-projects/eventonica/server) and client (techtonica-projects/eventonica/client).

3. `npm start` on server side and `npm run dev` on client side to run Eventonica app.

4. Visit `http://localhost:5050` for server site (ExpressJS, NodeJS) and `http://localhost:5173` for client site (React + Vite).
